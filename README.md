This project was produced by me for one of potencional employer as test task.

In this project I used many technoligies with react framework, such as:
- use approach "controlled components" in form
- use field mask, developed specifically for React, instead of traditional jQuery mask
- each React component must have their personal css file to be an isolated component
- use special version of Bootstrap for React "react-bootstrap"
- use PropTypes for cheking type of value in form fields

This project is deployed by address https://razorsrider.github.io/form-validation-react/
