This project was produced by me for one of potencional employer as test task.

In this project I applied in the first time many technoligies according with react framework, like as:
- use approach "controlled components" in form
- use field mask, developed special for React, instead traditional jQuery mask
- each React component must have their personal css file to be isolated component
- use special version of Bootstrap for React "react-bootstrap"
- use PropTypes for cheking type of value in fields of form
